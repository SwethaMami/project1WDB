                                <p>Albert Einstein was a brilliant physicist and one of the most influential scientists of the 20th century. He is best known for his theory of relativity, which fundamentally changed our understanding of space and time, and laid the groundwork for modern physics.

                                    Einstein was a prolific thinker and writer, and his work had far-reaching implications beyond physics. He was a passionate advocate for peace and social justice, and his letters and essays on these topics continue to inspire people around the world today.
                                    
                                    In addition to his groundbreaking scientific work, Einstein was also a gifted teacher and mentor. He was known for his patience and kindness with his students, and many of his former pupils went on to become leading scientists in their own right.
                                    
                                    Overall, Einstein's legacy is one of intellectual curiosity, creativity, and a deep commitment to using science for the betterment of humanity. His contributions to our understanding of the universe and our place in it will continue to inspire generations of scientists and thinkers for years to come.

                                <p><li>Einstein graduated from the renowned Swiss Polytechnic Institute at the age of 21, and he was struggling to find employment. To make matters worse, Einstein had a terrible reputation as a student.</li>
                                    <li>He skipped class, and his professors never took him seriously. Moreover, Einstein never performed spectacular in school. He did so poorly that he nearly decided to drop out, and just sell life insurance.</li>
                                    <li>After graduating, Einstein had to work many odd jobs to sustain himself. Einstein’s father died believing he was a complete failure. Einstein was absolutely heartbroken.</li>
                                    <li>Eventually, he found legitimate employment as a patent clerk. Every day, he would sit down, review patents, and analyze mathematical equations (patents had a lot of math in them). And Einstein loved it (and the rest is history from here).</li>

           <p>I used to spend hours playing the violin while he goes bird- watching. He said, “I often think in music. I live my daydreams in music.
